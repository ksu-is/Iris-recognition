This is my road map file.
Found this repository https://github.com/OmarMedhat22/Iris-Recognition-CASIA-Iris-Thousand, had trouble running but a very short code I can use for my project
Found new code to read Iris from this file https://github.com/aps19/densefly-iris-indexing/blob/main/finetuning_model.py
added code from the file it's kind of hard to navigate and difficult to fully understand
